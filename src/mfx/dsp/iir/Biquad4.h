        Biquad4.h
        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2020

Substitute for Biquad4Simd when no SIMD instruction set is available and
DATA amount is low.

Functions using fstb::Vf32 types are not implemented.

There is no latency for serial processing, so the _immediate and _latency map
to the same functions.

        XFadeEqPowPoly8.h
        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2021

Original formula:
Geraint Luff, A cheap energy-preserving-ish crossfade, 2021-02-12
https://signalsmith-audio.co.uk/writing/2021/cheap-energy-crossfade/

Maximum is 1.003 at 0.1058

Modification:
(0.975 + 1.51 * a) gives a result always <= 1 while keeping the ripples low
for the power sum, although derivative at the top (out = 1) is not 0.

Template parameters:

- OFLAG: uses the original formula instead of the modified one

Piece-wise linear approximation of a signed square root.

Template parameters:

- VD: class writing and reading memory with SIMD vectors (destination access).
	Typically, the fstb::DataAlign classes for aligned and unaligned data.
	Requires:
	static bool VD::check_ptr (const void *ptr);
	static fstb::Vs32 VD::load_s32 (const void *ptr);
	static void VD::store_s32 (void *ptr, const fstb::Vs32 val);

- VS: same as VD, but for reading only (source access)
	Requires:
	static bool VS::check_ptr (const void *ptr);
	static fstb::Vs32 VS::load_s32 (const void *ptr);

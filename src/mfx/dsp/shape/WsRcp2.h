Pure linear part in [-t ; t], asymptotes at -2t and +2t
t     = 0.5
f0(x) = t / max (abs (x), t)
f(x)  = x * f0(x) * (2 - f0(x))

Template parameters:

- VD: class writing and reading memory with SIMD vectors (destination access).
	Typically, the fstb::DataAlign classes for aligned and unaligned data.
	Requires:
	static bool VD::check_ptr (const void *ptr);
	static fstb::Vf32 VD::load_f32 (const void *ptr);
	static void VD::store_f32 (void *ptr, const fstb::Vf32 val);

- VS: same as VD, but for reading only (source access)
	Requires:
	static bool VS::check_ptr (const void *ptr);
	static fstb::Vf32 VS::load_f32 (const void *ptr);

        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2020

Template parameters:

- S: prescaling as std::ratio. Quantisation steps are 1/S. > 0.

- L: flag to enable clipping between -1 and +1.

- VD: class writing and reading memory with SIMD vectors (destination access).
	Typically, the fstb::DataAlign classes for aligned and unaligned data.
	Requires:
	static bool VD::check_ptr (const void *ptr);
	static fstb::Vf32 VD::load_f32 (const void *ptr);
	static void VD::store_f32 (void *ptr, const fstb::Vf32 val);

- VS: same as VD, but for reading only (source access)
	Requires:
	static bool VS::check_ptr (const void *ptr);
	static fstb::Vf32 VS::load_f32 (const void *ptr);

Name: process_sample_split
Description:
	Split (spectrum-wise) in half a pair of samples. The lower part of the

	The higher part is the complementary signal: original filter response
	is flipped from left to right, becoming a high-pass filter with the same
	cutoff frequency. This signal is then critically sampled (decimation by 2),
	flipping the spectrum: Fs/4...Fs/2 becomes Fs/4...0.
Input parameters:
	- in_ptr: pointer on the pair of input samples
Output parameters:
	- low: output sample, lower part of the spectrum (downsampling)
	- high: output sample, higher part of the spectrum.
Throws: Nothing

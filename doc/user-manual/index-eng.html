<h2><a id="intro"></a>I.&emsp;Introduction</h2>

<p><i>Pédale Vite</i> is a DIY multi-effect pedalboard for guitar.
This manual explains how to use the pedalboard once assembled and functional.</p>



<h2><a id="usage"></a>II.&emsp;Usage</h2>



<h3><a id="description"></a>Hardware description</h3>

<h4>Back panel</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Guitar audio input</li>
<li>Audio output to amplifier or mixing desk</li>
<li>Jacks for expression pedals</li>
<li>Fuse holder</li>
<li>220–240&#8239;V power lead</li>
<li>Power switch</li>
</ol>
<div class="pic"><a href="panel-rear.png"><img src="panel-rear-small.png" /></a></div>
<p>The first expression pedal is on the left hand side of the panel, and
therefore on the right hand side when facing the pedalboard.
Same for the audio inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>All jacks are balanced ¼”.</p>
<p>Impedences of the audio inputs are above 2&#8239;MΩ for the jacks,
2.2&#8239;kΩ for the XLR with the mic preamp.
Use the first channel to connect the guitar or any other mono signal.
When the pedalboard is set to mono, both outputs send the same signal.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> do not plug a Pédale Vite output on a device
(mixing console or other) input whose phantom power is turned on.
It would damage the outputs; they are not coupled with capacitors.</p>

<h4>Front panel</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;" start="8">
<li>Effect control knob</li>
<li>Display</li>
<li>Navigation knobs</li>
<li>Navigation buttons</li>
<li>Control LED, their use depends on the context.</li>
<li>Two rows of six footswitches to change the effects.</li>
</ol>
<div class="pic"><a href="panel-top.png"><img src="panel-top-small.png" /></a></div>
<p>The navigation buttons are arranged as follows.
Top row&#8239;:
Select/validate (<span class="key">Select</span>), top arrow
(<span class="keya">↑</span>), cancel/escape
(<span class="key">Esc</span>).
Bottom row&#8239;: left arrow (<span class="keya">←</span>),
down arrow (<span class="keya">↓</span>),
right arrow (<span class="keya">→</span>).</p>
<p>Navigation knobs are usually redundant with navigation buttons.
The left one allows to move vertically, and the right one to move horizontally
or to change a value.
These knobs may also be pressed, as keys.
Depending on the context, the left (<span class="key">LShift</span>) and right
(<span class="key">RShift</span>) keys alter the functionalities of other keys.
Unless specifically mentionned, holding <span class="key">LShift</span>
depressed activates the page scrolling, and <span class="key">RShift</span>
makes finer parameter modifications.</p>



<h3><a id="startup"></a>Startup</h3>

<div class="pic"><a href="how-to-plug.png"><img src="how-to-plug-small.png" /></a></div>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Connect the power lead (5).</li>
<li>Plug the guitar on the left input (1).</li>
<li>Plug the left output (2) on an amplifier.</li>
<li>Switch on the pedalboard (6).</li>
</ol>
<p>After less than ten seconds, the display should show the current program,
called <span class="ui">&lt;Empty prog&gt;</span>, a simple bypass.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="current-program-bypass.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;" start="5">
<li>Switch on the amplifier.</li>
<li>Play.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sound is too loud? Too quiet? You don’t hear anything?
Please report to the <a href="#calibration">calibration</a> section.</p>
<p>To stop, perform operations in reverse order:
switch off the amplifier, switch off the pedalboard and unplug it.</p>
<p>Note: it is not recommended to have the amplifier running while the
pedalboard is switched on or off.</p>



<h3><a id="calibration"></a>Calibration</h3>

<p>In order for the pedalboard to give optimum results, it must be calibrated,
especially the input and output levels.
The goal is to have as strong an input level as possible without the incoming
guitar signal saturating at that point.
Then, if you play on an amp, you have to go out at a level similar to the
guitar plugged in directly.</p>
<p>Press the <span class="key">Select</span> button, scroll down to the
<span class="ui">Volume &amp; Levels</span> menu, and press
<span class="key">Select</span> again.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="main-menu-levels.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>This takes you to the level control screen.
The upper meter shows the input levels, the middle one the output levels.
The levels to be considered (peaks) are given by the small strokes moving
to the right of the solid bars (RMS).</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="levels.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<h4>Input level</h4>

<p>Play as hard as possible.
Input level should never exceed 0&#8239;dB, and rarely go above
&minus;6&#8239;dB.
However it should be as high as possible.</p>
<p>Input level is set at the minimum by default, which is fine for an
electric guitar plugged directly to the pedalboard.
Anyway, it may be required to adjust it, for example if your guitar has a too
low output.</p>
<p>Turn the input 1 gain knob until the level looks correct.
Then set the same level on the input 2.</p>

<h4>Output level</h4>

<p>Once we are done with the input level, we can set the output level.
Make sure an empty program (“Bypass”) is activated, so the guitar input goes
directly to the output without any modification.</p>
<p>Go to the Output volume settings with the vertical arrows.
Change the volume with the horizontal arrows.</p>
<p>Then set the output level on the audio interface in order to get the
same sound as with a guitar plugged directly to the amplifier.
An AB/Y box is a great help for this.
If you don’t have one, you can plug alternatively the guitar on the
pedalboard and on the amplifier to compare the volumes.</p>



<h3><a id="baby-steps"></a>First steps</h3>

<p>&hellip;</p>



<h2><a id="reference"></a>III.&emsp;Reference</h2>



<h3><a id="concept"></a>Concept</h3>

<p>Effects on the pedalboard are organized in <dfn>programs</dfn>.
A program is made of an effect chain and some settings to control the effects
from footswitches, pedals and knobs, the <dfn>controllers</dfn>.</p>
<p>Programs are grouped in <dfn>banks</dfn>.
Each bank is made of 16 programs, and the pedalboard contains 64 banks.
The pedalboard makes easy the navigation between the programs of a single
bank.</p>
<p>A program is made of an effect chain.
For each effect, it is possible to set its volume, the mix between the
input signal and the output signal, and to bypass the processing.</p>



<h3><a id="leds"></a>LEDs</h3>

<p>There are three LEDs on the pedalboard, a green one surrounded by
two red ones.
Their meaning depends on the context, on the activated function.
Usually they should be off, excepted when using the tuner.</p>

<h4>Normal operations</h4>

<div class="picr"><img src="led-1.png" /></div>
<p>The leftmost red LED indicates that the output sound clips.
You should lower the main volume or the volume of one of the activated
effects.</p>
<div class="picr"><img src="led-2.png" /></div>
<p>The green LED indicates that the pedalboard is performing a write operation
on the internal drive (the SD card).
Such an operation is usually quick, anyway make sure not to switch off the
pedalboard at this moment.
The memory card is delicate and could be damaged.</p>
<div class="picr"><img src="led-3.png" /></div>
<p>The rightmost red LED indicates that the processing unit is overloaded.
There are too much simultaneous effects, or they have too complex settings,
and the sound cannot be produced on time.
It is suitable to recall a simpler program, or to change the effect parameters
to reduce the load.
It can also be a temporary overload, in which case there is nothing special
to do.
The sound should come back and the LED turn off.</p>
<div class="picr"><img src="led-123.png" /></div>
<p>However, if the overload lasts, the audio engine gives up its recovery
attempt.
This state is indicated with all the three LEDs lit.
In this case, a simpler program should be activated and the audio engine
restarted manually.
This can be obtained by pressing <span class="key">Esc</span> three times
on the main screen.</p>


<h4>Tuner</h4>

<p>In tuner mode, the LEDs indicates the rightness of the played note.
The leftmost LED indicates that the note is too low, and the rightmost
one that the note is too high.</p>
<p>When the played note is right, the green LED is lit.</p>



<h3><a id="screen-main"></a>Main screens</h3>

<h4>Current program and information</h4>

<p>This is the startup screen.
This is also the one on the top of the menu hierarchy.
If you get lost, just press <span class="key">Esc</span> one or more times to
get back here.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="prog-cur.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>Several important information are displayed here:
On the top, the current program and bank.
On the middle, the controllers used by the program or the last modified parameter.
On the bottom, the Raspberry Pi IP address, if it is available.
Indeed it is required to connect on the machine with SSH for maintenance
operations.</p>
<p>The <span class="key">Esc</span> key in this screen activates some other
functions.
They depends how many times the key is pressed:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Updates the display, particularly the IP address.</li>
<li>Resets the display hardware.</li>
<li>Resets the audio engine.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Main menu</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="main-menu-levels.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>This screen is reached by pressing <span class="key">Select</span> in the
current program screen.
It can be exited with <span class="key">Esc</span>.
Navigation is done with <span class="keya">↑</span> and
<span class="keya">↓</span>.
<span class="key">Select</span> opens the page highlighted with the cursor.</p>
<table>

<h3><a id="screen-prog-edit"></a>Editing a program</h3>

<h4><a id="screen-fx-chain"></a>Effect chain</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="prog-edit.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>This is the main page to edit a program.
Navigations is done with the <span class="keya">↑</span> and
<span class="keya">↓</span> keys.
<span class="key">Select</span> enters the highlighted object
et <span class="key">Esc</span> gets back to the current program screen.</p>
<p>The first line is the program name, which can be edited.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Settings…</span> gives access to various program-related
settings.</p>
<p><a href="#screen-prog-save"><span class="ui">Save to…</span></a>
saves the currently edited program.</p>
<p>The following list is the effect chain, in processing order.
The sound is processed from the top, down to the bottom of the list.
Effects are shown as a linear list, but their routing can be much more
complex, with multiple branchs (graph).
Each line is a distinct effet.
<span class="ui">&lt;Empty&gt;</span> indicates that there is no effect
on the line and <span class="ui">&lt;End&gt;</span> terminates the list.
Disconnected effects, or effect chains not connected to the audio output are
located at the end of the list.</p>
<p>The small discs next to each effects indicate the chain segment in which
the selected effect is located.
The displayed segment stops to the first fork in the audio processing&#8239;:
upstream when several effects are mixed together, and downstream when the
signal is spread out to several effets.
Effects involved in these possible forks are indicated with an outlined
circle.</p>
<p>When the audio input and output are not linked by any effect chain, a
warning message is displayed on the top line.</p>
<p>A line written in bold indicates that at least one controller applies on
the effect.</p>
<p>The effect on the highlighted line (including
<span class="ui">&lt;Empty&gt;</span> and <span class="ui">&lt;End&gt;</span>)
can be changed with <span class="keya">←</span> and
<span class="keya">→</span>.
These keys sweep all the available effects.
If <span class="ui">&lt;End&gt;</span> is replaced with an effect, a new
empty line is automatically inserted after.
In return, it is possible to remove the effect from the last line.
<span class="key">Select</span> gives access to <a href="#screen-fx-setup">the
effect configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the last list shows the effects that don’t need audio to work,
like the LFOs for example.</p>
<p>Configurations and parameters are memorized for each kind of effect.
If the effect type is changed by mistake, settings are kept and applied
back when the initial effect is restored.
It’s also possible to try several effects by adjusting their parameters
and comparing them without hasle.</p>
<p>Also, an effect of a new kind generally appears with the same configuration
it had during its previous instantiation.
To restart from default settings, one can use <span class="ui">Reset</span>
from the <a href="#screen-fx-setup">Effect Configuration</a>.</p>
<p>When the automatic parameter assign option is activated (see the
<a href="#screen-othersettings">Other settings</a> screen), the 5 rotary
encoders are assigned temporarily to the 5 first parameters of the selected
effect.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-prog-save"></a>Save Program</h4>

<p>When a program is saved, the program list from the current bank is
displayed.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="prog-list.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>The very first line indicates the bank where the program will be saved.
It is possible to change the bank with the horizontal arrows.</p>
<p>The program slot where the settings shall be overwritten is chosen with
<span class="key">Select</span>.
The bold line indicates the active program.
It is the default selection.
<span class="key">Esc</span> cancels the operation and gets back to
<a href="#screen-fx-chain">the effect chain</a>.</p>
<p>Once the saving location is validated, one can type the the program
name.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="prog-save.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The screen title reminds the storage location.
The name correspounding to active settings is pre-filled.
One can modify it by navigating in the list of characters.
<span class="key">Select</span> validates the highlighted character or action.
<span class="key">Esc</span> cancels the operation and gets back to the
<a href="#screen-fx-chain">effect chain</a>.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">OK</span></td><td>Validates the choice and does the data saving. The green LED lights up shortly during this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">CANCEL</span></td><td>Cancels the operation.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">SPC</span></td><td>Insert a space at the carret location.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">DEL</span></td><td>Delete the character at the left of the carret.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">←</span> and <span class="ui">→</span></td><td>Move the carret.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Parameter list</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="param-list.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>The first line <span class="ui">FX setup…</span> jumps to the
<a href="#screen-fx-setup">Effect Configuration</a> screen.
For some effects, there can be a second line
<span class="ui">Graphic editing…</span> to edit the parameters using a
graphic representation.
It’s the case for <a href="#fx-peq">PEq</a> for example.</p>
<p>The following three lines are common to all the effects and deal with the
mixing parameters.
The value is on the right of the parameter.
The following lines are specific to the effect.
A parameter written in bold indicates that it is modulated by at least one
controller.</p>
<p>One can change the selected parameter with the horizontal arrows, and
enter the 
<a href="#screen-param-edit">Parameter Edit</a> screen (more accurate values,
controllers…) with <span class="key">Select</span>.</p>

<p class="var">Bypass</p>
<p>Deactivate the effect when set to <span class="ui">On</span>.</p>

<p class="var">Effect mix</p>
<p>Mixes the effect output with its input.
The parameters indicates the output ratio, in percent.</p>

<p class="var">Volume</p>
<p>Adjustment output volume, in dB.
This parameters helps to homogenize the volume, within the effect chain
and between the different programs.
This volume is applied before the input/output mix.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-param-edit"></a>Parameter Edit</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="param-edit.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The name, the value and possibly the unit of the parameter are indicated
on the top.</p>
<p>One can change the parameter value using four scale factors (the dots)
and the horizontal arrows.</p>
<p>The <span class="ui">Controllers…</span> line allows to
<a href="#screen-control-choice">chose</a> the direct links and modulations
for the parameters by pressing <span class="key">Select</span>.
Bold face indicates that at least one controller is attached to the parameter.
The last line is about time parameters.
It indicates (if relevant) if the parameters follows the tempo or if it is
independant from it.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-control-choice"></a>Controller Choice</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="controllers.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>Two types of controllers can be selected here:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ui">Direct link</span>: the controller drives directly the
parameter value.
There is at most one per parameter.</li>
<li><span class="ui">Modulations</span>: it’s a list of additive controllers
modulating the value.
There can be several of them and their order isn’t important.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can navigate using the vertical arrows and go to the
<a href="#screen-control-edit">Controller Edit</a> screen with
<span class="key">Select</span>.
A line <span class="ui">&lt;Empty&gt;</span> indicates that there is no
controller attached here.
It is always there at the end of the modulation list to allow adding a new one.
One can go back to the <a href="#screen-param-edit">Parameter Edit</a> screen
with the <span class="key">Esc</span> key.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-control-edit"></a>Controller Edit</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="control-edit1.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<div class="pic"><img src="control-edit2.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>One can setup a controller (direct link or modulation) on this screen.
A direct link controller requires two parameter values:
a value for the controller’s low position, and another for the high position.
The parameter will take all the values between these bounds.
By default, the minimum and maximum parameter values are used.</p>
<p>A modulation controller requires only one setting, its depth, in percent
of the parameter range.</p>
<p>The first line <span class="ui">Src</span> indicates the controller source.
One can chose it by cycling within the list using the horizontal arrows.
The available sources are the following ones:</p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="2"><span class="ui">&lt;Empty/Delete&gt;</span></td><td>Only for editing. Indicates that there is no controller or it is to be deleted.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Expression</span></td><td>0–2</td><td>Expression pedals.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Knob</span></td><td>0–4</td><td>Rotary encoders.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Footsw</span></td><td>0–11</td><td>Footswitches.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There can be other modulation sources, depending on the program configuration:
LFOs, envelope followers…
These sources appear first on the list.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Step</span> is only for rotary encoders.
It selects its sensitivity.
The fractional value indicates the fraction of the parameter range between two
consecutive steps.
It can be set with the horizontal arrows.</p>
<p>Below, there are the bounding values.
They depend on the controller type.
They are changed exactly like in the <a href="#screen-param-edit">Parameter
Edit</a> screen.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Final</span> indicates the final, modulated parameter
value.
If the parameter is modulated by multiple source, the final value reflects
the contribution of all the modulations, not the edited one only.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Curve</span> selects the curve to apply on the source.
It changes the controller sensitivity depending on the value ranges.

<div class="pic"><img src="control-edit-curve.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p><span class="ui">Range</span> is used only on modulation with some specific
sources only.
It can convert a unipolar signal (posivite values only) into a bipolar signal
(positive and negative values).
The signal shape is preserved, the value range is just stretched down to the
negative range.
This allows putting the neutral modulation value in the middle of the
controller course.
One can select <span class="ui">Bipolar</span> or
<span class="ui">Unipolar</span> with the horizontal arrows.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Clip</span> restricts the source range.
The main purpose is to assign their own variation range to different

<span class="ui">Clip</span> is processed after the
<span class="ui">Range</span> function.
<span class="ui">Src&larr;</span> and <span class="ui">Src&rarr;</span> clip

<h4><a id="screen-fx-setup"></a>Effect Configuration</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="fx-setup.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The first line indicates the effect type, which can be changed with the
horizontal arrows.
Press <span class="key">Select</span> to access a menu where all the effects
are sorted into categories.
The current effect and its categories are listed in bold&#8239;:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="fx-select-tags.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p><span class="ui">Insert before</span> adds an empty block in the chain
before the selected effect.
This empty block becomes the current effect and is immediately editable.
If the effect doesn’t use any audio source, its position is irrelevant and
the entry is simply called <span class="ui">Insert</span>.</p>
<p>The following menu entries may or may not appear, depending on the
nature and the current state of the effect&#8239;:</p>
<p><span class="ui">Insert after</span> adds an empty block in the chain
after the selected effect.
This empty block becomes the current effect.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Routing…</span> reaches a the
<a href="#screen-fx-routing">routing menu</a> to connect, disconnect and move
the effect within the audio graph.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Presets…</span> leads to the
<a href="#screen-fx-presets">preset</a> menu.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Reset</span> restores the default parameters.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Chan</span> is useful for effects that can convert a
mono signal to stereo (chorus, delay…)
<span class="ui">Auto</span> selects the stereo, which will be
effective only with a global stereo output.
<span class="ui">prefer mono</span> keeps the mono signal in all the cases.
If the input signal is already stereo, it keeps stereo, whatever the selected
option.
Use <span class="key">Select</span> to change the settings.</p>
<p><span class="ui">State</span> indicates if the effect memory must be
cleaned (<span class="ui">fresh</span>) when the program is activated, or kept
from the previous use (<span class="ui">keep</span>).
Cleaning the memory may have an impact on the response time but should be
light.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Name</span> is the name of the effect instance.
It can be used to identify it with global-range pedals and controllers, not
depending on the program.
For example, you can have a pedalboard-range footswitch to change the bypass
state of any effect called “distortion”.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-fx-routing"></a>Routing</h4>

<p>In this screens you can connect ot disconnect the effect to other effects,
or move it through the audio graph.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="fx-routing.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p><span class="ui">Move…</span> moves the effect within the chain.
After having pressed on <span class="key">Select</span>, the chain appears and
it is possible to move the effect with the vertical arrows.
Changes are immediately effective.
<span class="key">Select</span> or <span class="key">Esc</span> to exit.</p>
<p>The other lines below show the connections to each input and output pin.
When the target effect has several pins, the pin number is displayed next to
the connection after an hyphen.</p>
<p><strong>Note&#8239;:</strong> listed pins can be different of the real pin
set of the effect.
It means that some connections may lead to nothing if the effect cannot handle
them.
This allows changing easily the effect without destroying the connections each
time they are incompatible with the new effect.</p>
<p>Press <span class="key">Select</span> on a pin to add a connection you can
select in the list.
Only the new possible connections are shown, the ones not creating loops in
the audio graph.
<span class="key">Esc</span> to cancel.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="fx-routing-add.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>Press <span class="key">Select</span> on a connection to delete it or to
replace it by another one from the list.
<span class="key">Esc</span> to cancel.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="fx-routing-edit.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>There are two other types of input and output, <span class="ui">Send</span>
and <span class="ui">Return</span>.
This is a way to build loops across the effect connection graph and create
internal feedback.
Indeed, anything entering a <span class="ui">Send</span> exits from the
corresponding <span class="ui">Return</span>, that can be located upstream.
There are 4 different send-return paths available.
The feedback is not instantaneous like in an analogue effect, there is a delay
of about a millisecond.
Because feedback can quickly build up and degenerate, any signal entering a
<span class="ui">Send</span> is systematically clipped to +24&#8239;dBFS.
Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to insert a limiter just before in
order to tame the signal.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-fx-presets"></a>Presets</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="fx-preset.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>In this menu you can manage the stored presets for the current effect.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-banks-orga"></a>Organize banks and programs</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="bank-orga.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>This menu gives access to several operations allowing to organize banks and
programs.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Move banks…</span> is for moving banks within the bank
list.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Move programs…</span> is for moving programs within the
current bank.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Program catalog</span> gives accès to a complete list of
all the programs from all the banks.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-banks-move-bank"></a>Move banks</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="bank-move-1.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>First, with the vertical arrows, select a bank to move.
<span class="key">Select</span> to validate or
<span class="key">Esc</span> to return to the previous menu.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="bank-move-2.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>Once the bank is selected, use the vertical arrows to move this bank.
<span class="key">Select</span> to validate the move or
<span class="key">Esc</span> to cancel and return to the previous menu.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-banks-move-prog"></a>Move programs</h4>

<h4><a id="screen-banks-prog-cat"></a>Program catalog</h4>

<p>This page lists all the programs from all the banks, without duplicates
nor empty programs.
The first program of the list is activated when entering the page.
Use the vertical arrows to browse.
Programs are automatically activated when browsed through.
<span class="key">Esc</span> to return to the previous menu.
Upon return, the current bank and current program reflect the last browsed
program from the list.</p>

<h3><a id="screen-pedalboard-config"></a>Pedalboard configuration</h3>

<p>This part is used to adjust the action of each footswitch at the global
level.
It is also possible to adjust these settings at the bank and program level,
the menus are identical and the configured actions overlap.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="pedalboard-layout.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The list above allows you to see at a glance what each footswitch does.
The twelve footswitches are numbered in two rows: first the bottom (the
closest), from 1 to 6 from the left to the right, then the top (farthest) from
7 to 12.
Use the vertical arrows to navigate and
<span class="key">Select</span> to edit a footswitch.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="pedalboard-layout-pedal-menu.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>In this menu, <span class="ui">Full edit…</span> allows editing the content
of the footswitch and <span class="ui">Clear/empty</span> to reset it.
The other functions are not implemented yet.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="pedalboard-layout-pedal-fulledit.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The menu above gives access to the three footswitch trigger modes and
indicates whether or not this mode is used.
The modes are the following:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Press</span></td><td>Immediate action when pressed</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Hold</span></td><td>Action after having hold it pressed for about 2 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Release</span></td><td>Action when the footswitch is released</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The three modes can be used simultaneously to obtain different functions
from the same footswitch.
However when <span class="ui">Hold</span> is used, it is recommended to move
the <span class="ui">Press</span> content to <span class="ui">Release</span>
in order to avoid unwanted aliasing.</p>
<p>There is no automatic repeat like on a computer keyboard.
A new action is triggered only after the footswitch state is actually
changed.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="pedalboard-layout-cycle.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>Each triggering mode is linked to a cycle made of one or more
<span class="ui">Step</span>s.
When the footswitch is triggerred, a cycle step is activated, and the next
trigger will activate the next step in the cycle, until the cycle is finished
and starts again.</p>
<p>In a majority of cases, cycles only have one steps.
On the other hand, the <span class="ui">Hold</span> and
<span class="ui">Release</span> modes accept only one step.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="pedalboard-layout-step.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The menu above allows you to modify a step.
A step consists of one or more actions that will be carried out simultaneously
when the step is activated.
Below are the available actions:</p>
<ul>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Bank</span></td><td>Activates a given bank, or switches to the next or the previous one.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Program</span></td><td>Activates a given program, or switches to the next or the previous one.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Tuner toggle</span></td><td>Activates or deactivates the tuner.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">FX toggle</span></td><td>Activates or deactivates effects. 
The effects can be identified by their type or by their name.
When several effects are targeted, they all switch to the same states.
If some of the switching effects require to stay in the state opposite to the others, use a second <span class="ui">FX toggle</span> associated to a second label.</td></tr>

</ul>



<h3><a id="screen-levels"></a>Volume and levels</h3>

<div class="pic"><img src="levels.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>This screen shows and controls the levels.
The bars indicate the input and output volumes.
When a bar is split, it means that the signal is stereo.
This is always the case for the input, even if only the left channel is taken
into account in the effect chain.
The small 
The small line indicates the level of the peaks with a stationary time of
2&#8239;s, and the solid bar the RMS volume.</p>
<p>The <span class="ui">DSP</span> bar indicates the CPU resources eaten by
the audio processing.
The hatched part is the average load, and the solid part the peaks.
They should stay as low as possible and never touch the right part of the
gauge, otherwise clicks and sound loss may occur.</p>
<p>It is possible to set the <span class="ui">Output</span> volume
with the horizontal arrows.</p>
<p>The symbols at the left of the <span class="ui">DSP</span> gauge indicate
if the input and output are mono (one circle) or stereo (two interlaced
circles).</p>
<p>When the cursor is on the <span class="ui">DSP</span>, the audio engine
can be restarted by pressing on <span class="key">Select</span>.</p>



<h3><a id="screen-othersettings"></a>Other settings</h3>

<div class="pic"><img src="other-settings.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p><span class="ui">Tempo</span> sets the tempo in quarter notes per minute.
It is possible to set the integer part or the fractional part of the
tempo.
Pressing <span class="key">Select</span> on the fractional part rounds
the tempo to the nearest integer.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Click</span> activates or deactivates the click, based
on the tempo setting.
At the moment, the time signature is restricted to 4/4.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Save settings</span> immediately saves the current

<h4><a id="screen-backup"></a>Backup menu</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="backup-menu.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p>Before doing a backup copy, you must ensure that the date is correctly set,
with the risk of being confused by an inconsistent timestamping.</p>
<p>The screen accessed with <span class="ui">Set date…</span> may be used to
set the current date and time.
Indeed, the internal computer does not have a system to keep the time between
two sessions.
So it may be necessary to set the date before doing a backup copy of the
settings.
However, if the machine is connected to the internet during startup, the date
is automatically updated.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> time and date are UTC (coordinated universal
time), not the local time.</p>
<p>In this screen, use the vertical arrows to select the field to edit,
and the horizontal arrows to modify the values.
The date is automatically updated when exiting the screen with
<span class="key">Esc</span> or <span class="key">Select</span>.
Because of technical reasons, the program is restarted after a date
modification, so any unsaved change may be lost.</p>

<div class="pic"><img src="backup-date.png" class="reduce" /></div>

<p><span class="ui">Save backup now</span> does a backup copy.
The file is saved in the same directory as the main settings (namely
<code>/opt/pedalevite/etc/config/</code>), with the current date and time
following its name.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Restore backup…</span> is still under construction.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Export to USB stick</span> saves the backup on an external
USB drive.
It is automatically mounted (<code>/mnt/sda1</code>, FAT32) and unmounted during
the backup.</p>

<h4><a id="screen-record"></a>Record</h4>

<div class="pic"><img src="record-to-disk.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>This feature records both the raw audio input and output.
The audio is recorded in a unique file,
<code>/opt/pedalevite/var/audiodump/raw-in-out.wav</code>.
This is a 32-bit floating point WAV file.
There are 4 channels, two for the input, and two for the output, whatever the
stereo settings in the <span class="ui">Volume and levels</span> page.
The file is overwritten at the beginning of each recording.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Record</span> starts and stops the recording, with the
<span class="key">Select</span> key.
The current recording duration is displayed between parenthesis.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Limit</span> sets the maximum file size.
Use the horizontal arrows to modify the duration.
When the specified time is elapsed, the recording head goes back to the
beginning of the file, in a cyclic way.
It is not possible to change the limit once the recording is started.
It is not possible to use all the available disk space.
About 100&#8239;MB are left free.</p>
<p><span class="ui">Avail</span> shows the maximum available recording
duration, depending on the disk capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> the program write to the disk all over the
recording course.
To preserve the SD card, do not switch the power off nor unplug Pédale Vite
during the recording.
Before, explicitely terminate the current recording or use one of the entries
in the <span class="ui">Restart</span> menu to shut down Pédale Vite
gracefully.</p>



<h3><a id="screen-tuner"></a>Tuner</h3>

<p>Several tuning types can be selected with the horizontal arrows:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Guitar</span></td><td>E A<sub>110</sub> D G B E, default setting</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Bass</span></td><td>E A<sub>55</sub> D G</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Chromatic</span></td><td>All the notes of the chromatic scale</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The closest detected note in the selected scale is displayed.
The LEDs show if the tuning is right or not.
The error in cent is also given on the display.</p>


<h3><a id="screen-restart"></a>Restart</h3>

<div class="pic"><img src="restart.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<ul>
<li><span class="ui">Cancel</span> comes back to the main screen.</li>
<li><span class="ui">Restart</span> restarts the application, which can be useful in case of peristent glitch or bug. The current program state is lost.</li>
<li><span class="ui">Reboot</span> reboot the operating system. The operation lasts about ten seconds. Warning, the audio interface may issue loud clicks. Please lower your amplifier volume(s) before proceeding.</li>
<li><span class="ui">Shutdown</span> prepares the machine for a manual shutdown. It is not necessary to use this option each time you want to shutdown the pedalboard; this is mainly a maintenance operation.</li>

<h2><a id="effect-list"></a>IV.&emsp;Available effects</h2>



<h3><a id="fx-distapf"></a>All-Pass Distortion</h3>

<p>A distortion based on the modulation of an all-pass filter.
Unlike saturation-based distortions, it produces extra-harmonics without
affecting the volume.
The overall result sounds between a light overdrive and a broken fuzz.</p>

<p class="var">Gain</p>
<p>Gain of the modulator, in dB.
The more gain, the more harmonic are produced.</p>

<p class="var">Slew-rate limiting</p>
<p>This parameter limits the highest frequencies in the modulation signal,
reducing harsh tones.
The lower the rate, the softer the tones.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-badradio"></a>Bad radio — Distortion</h3>

<p>This effects emulate a bad radio reception.</p>

<p class="var">Gain</p>
<p>Distortion gain, in dB.</p>

<p class="var">Noisiness</p>
<p>Indicates how noisy the distortion sounds.</p>

<p class="var">Hiss</p>
<p>Level in dB of additional noise</p>

<p class="var">Noise bandwidth</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency in Hz for the noise low-pass filter.</p>

<p class="var">Low-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency in Hz for the distortion output low-cut (high-pass)
filter.</p>

<p class="var">High-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency in Hz for the distortion output high-cut (low-pass)
filter.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-bigmuffpi1"></a>Big Muff Pi — Distortion</h3>

<p>This is an accurate emulation of the Big Muff Pi distorsion (Green Russian
Tall Font model).</p>

<p class="var">Sustain</p>
<p>Distorsion gain, dB.</p>

<p class="var">Tone</p>
<p>Tone contrôle, in percent.
This is a kind of equalizer balancing bass and treble.
When the parameter is low, the bass part of the sound is amplified and the
treble part attenuated.
When it is high, it is the opposite.</p>

<p class="var">Volume</p>
<p>Output volume, dB.</p>

<p class="var">Oversampling rate</p>
<p>The choices are 1 (no oversampling), 2 or 4.
The higher the rate, the higher the emulation fidelity and the overall sound
quality, but at the expense of the CPU usage.</p>

<p class="var">Pre-gain</p>
<p>Linear gain applied just before the device input, in dB.
This parameter extends the <var>sustain</var> range.
Beware, with very high gains, the sound becomes muffled.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-chnmerge"></a>Channel Merge</h3>

<p>This utility effect takes two mono inputs to merge them into a stereo
output.
The first input goes to the left and the second one to the right.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-chnsplit"></a>Channel Split</h3>

<p>This utility effect takes a stereo input and splits the channels into two
mono outputs.
The left channel goes to the first output and the right channel to the second
output.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-colorme"></a>Color Me — Vocal filter</h3>

<p>Color Me sculpts the sound spectrum with formants (resonant bumps centered
around characteristic frequencies),
giving a vocal color.
A series of two to four vowels is chosen from a dozen.
The main parameter is used to make the transition between the selected vowels,
giving a sound tending towards one or the other.</p>
<p>Note: with very accentuated settings, it can be judicious to make follow
the effect with a compressor in order to limit too strong resonances.</p>

<p class="var">Vowel morphing</p>
<p>This parameter controls the transition between the selected vowels.
It is assigned by default to a free controller.</p>

<p class="var">Formant resonance</p>
<p>Each formant is modeled by a bell filter.
This parameter is used to adjust the resonance of this filter.</p>

<p class="var">Formant selectivity</p>
<p>Used to control the selectivity (Q) of the formant filter.
It is often best to vary it in conjunction with
<var>Formant resonance</var>.</p>

<p class="var">Formant transpose</p>
<p>Allows to shift the formants by more or less one octave.
This shift reflects the size of the emulated vocal apparatus and
influences the timbre of the synthetic voice, giving something from Jabba the
Hutt to Mickey Mouse.</p>

<p class="var">Number of formants</p>
<p>Only two formants make it possible to identify a vowel but the resulting
sound is somewhat weird.
A third formant gives more clarity and realism.
This parameter allows you to choose between two or three.</p>

<p class="var">Number of vowels</p>
<p>Number of voyels transformed by the <var>Vowel morphing</var>.</p>

<p class="var">Vowel 1, 2, 3, 4 type</p>
<p>Vowel type.

<h3><a id="fx-compex"></a>CompEx — Dynamics compressor/expander</h3>

<p>CompEx is a relatively simple dynamic processor and can do compression
and expansion.</p>
<p>First, set a threshold level.
The for each range above or below this level, one can select if the dynamics
will be increased or reduced.
Generally “above” is more interesting for compression. “Below” can be used
for gates.</p>

<p class="var">Ratio High</p>
<p>Dynamic amplification rate above the threshold.
If the rate is less than 1, the effect is a compressor.
If it is greater than 1, it’s an expander.
In this case the settings are sensitive and the result can be difficult
to control.</p>

<p class="var">Ratio Low</p>
<p>Dynamic amplification rate below the threshold.
Use a value greater than 1 to get a gate.</p>

<p class="var">Threshold</p>
<p>The threshold level.
The lower, the more the <var>Ratio High</var> effect is pronounced.</p>

<p class="var">Attack time</p>
<p>Attack time for the volume envelope detection, in ms.
The lower, the quicker the effect reacts to dymanic changes.</p>

<p class="var">Release time</p>
<p>Release time for the volume envelope detection.
Generally greater than the attack time by one order of magnitude.</p>

<p class="var">Make-up gain</p>
<p>Output volume.
Although volume compensation is automatically based on the <var>Ratio
High</var> value, manual adjustments are sometimes necessary.</p>

<p class="var">Knee shape</p>
<p>The threshold level is actually a range where the dynamic processing
changes progressively from the <var>Ratio Low</var> to the <var>Ratio
High</var>.
This parameter indicates the depth of the range.</p>

<h3><a id="fx-convert-mono"></a>Convert To Mono</h3>

<p>This effects turns a stereo input into a mono output.</p>

<p class="var">Source</p>
<p>Selects the conversion methode&#8239;:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Mix-6</span></td><td>Both channels are mixed to constant amplitude (ajustment to &minus;6&#8239;dB). This mode is for phase-coherent channels.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="ui">Left </span></td><td>Keeps only the left channel.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Right</span></td><td>Keeps only the right channel.</td></tr>
</table>



<h3><a id="fx-convert-stereo"></a>Convert To Stereo</h3>

<p>It’s not really an effect, it’s a device to help changing a mono source
to stereo.
With a mono input, the setting in the <a href="#screen-fx-setup">effect
configuration</a> is overriding the effect.
So please ensure that you are in <span class="ui">Auto</span>.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-delay"></a>Delay — Stereo delay</h3>

<p>A classic stereo echo effect.
It can generate a stereo signal from a mono input.</p>
<p>There are actually two independant delay lines, one for each channel.
For each line, one can set the delay time, its output level, the feedback
level and the feedback filtering (low- or high-pass).
By default, both lines are linked together and use the parameters from the
left line.</p>
<p>It is also possible to cross the line feedbacks.</p>

<p class="var">Input mix level</p>
<p>Dry level copied to the output.</p>

<p class="var">Delay mix level</p>
<p>Level of the delayed signal.</p>

<p class="var">Time L/R</p>
<p>Delay time for the left and right lines.</p>

<p class="var">Feedback L/R</p>
<p>Level of the output signal fed back into the lines.
When the level is 0, there is only one echo.
When it is close to 100&#8239;%, the echo is repeated almost infinitely.</p>

<p class="var">Filter L/R</p>
<p>Filtering of the line feedback.
When the rate is negative, the filter is a low-pass one.
When it is positive, the filter is a high-pass one.
The parameter is directly linked to the cutoff frequency.
The higher in absolute value, the stronger is the filtering.</p>

<p class="var">Channel link</p>
<p>Links the right channel to the left one.</p>

<p class="var">Ping-pong</p>
<p>Cross-feedback level.
At 0&#8239;%, both lines are independant.
At 100&#8239;%, the lines are completely crossed, giving the illusion that
the sound reflects from left to right and from right to left.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-dclip"></a>Diode clipper — Diode distortion</h3>

<p>Diode clipper is a realistic simulation of an antiparallel diode clipping
stage, as often found in numerous stompboxes and preamplifiers.
It comes with an integrated low-pass filter.</p>

<p class="var">Gain</p>
<p>Distortion gain, in dB.
The higher the gain, the stronger the distortion effect.
When this parameter is set below 0&#8239;dB, the gain is compensated
at the output, which increases the clipping threshold without lowering
the apparent volume.
This helps to free some headroom for the hotter signals.</p>

<p class="var">Low-pass filter cutoff frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency of the internal low-pass filter, in Hz.
This filter eliminates harsher frequencies, generated by high gain settings.
Because its working is closely tied to the clipping, its action is dependent
on the gain (or to the input signal power).
A very high gain will require to lower the cutoff frequency.</p>

<p class="var">Shape</p>
<p>This parameter changes the nature of the distortion stage diodes.
The hard models (<span class="ui">H</span>) clip the signal brutally and are
good for very distorded sounds, whereas soft ones (<span class="ui">S</span>)
clip more progressively and are more suited to crunch sounds.</p>

<p class="var">Preclip level</p>
<p>Threshold in dB after which the input signal is hard-clipped, before
entering the diode stage.
This parameter mimics the signal clipped at the voltage of the power
supply.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-disto3"></a>Distortion 3</h3>

<p>This distortion effect includes two specific simulations&#8239;: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_distortion">crossover
distortion</a> from a class B amplifier, and the overload of a symetric
power supply.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slew_rate">slew rate</a> limiter,
linking the trebble attenuation to the distortion gain.</p>

<p class="var">Input high-pass filter cutoff frequency</p>
<p>In Hz.
Cuts the bass frequencies at the effect input.
Actually this is a shelf filter, implicitly controlled by the
<var>distortion gain</var> parameter.
It is designed in order to let pass bass frequencies, but less amplified
than the other frequencies.
For a fixed setting, this helps keeping bass frequencies whatever the
gain variations, especially at low gain.</p>

<p class="var">Distortion gain</p>
<p>Amplificatin gain in dB.
This is the main distortion parameter.</p>

<p class="var">Slew rate limiting, input</p>
<p>Limits the slew rate after the gain and before the distortion.
This limiting filters the high frequencies depending on the signal strength.
The stronger, the more filtered.
The operation being non-linear, other dirts are added to the sound at this
stage.
The parameter is expressed in Hz, like the low-pass filter cutoff frequency,
although its actual meaning should be quite dependent on the gain.
The maximum value should be quite neutral at a moderate gain.</p>

<p class="var">Class</p>
<p>Selects on which amplification class (A or B) the distortion algorithms
are applied.
In B class, two distortion modules are used.
This setting mainly modifies the way the signal is modulated by the bias
parameter.
Crossover distortion appears in B class only.</p>

<p class="var">Bias, static</p>
<p>This parameter in % adds a fixed polarisation component in the distortion.
In B class, it reduces the crossover distortion for low signals, and push the
structure towards an AB class.</p>

<p class="var">Bias, dynamic</p>
<p>This parameter in % ajusts the polarisation component depending on the
sound envelope (before or after distortion, depending on the  <var>bias
source</var>).
The higher, the more the bias will be modified, and the more crossover
distortion in B class.</p>

<p class="var">Bias low-pass filter cutoff frequency</p>
<p>This is the filter smoothing the dynamic part of the bias.
Parameter is in Hz.
At very low frequency, the bias takes time to react, modulating the tone
across the time.</p>

<p class="var">Bias source</p>
<p>This parameter sets the bias source&#8239;: <span class="ui">direct</span>
is before the distortion, and <span class="ui">feedback</span> is after.
With feedback, the distortion may self-oscillate, depending on other
settings.</p>

<p class="var">Distortion type</p>
<p>Distortion algorithm.
Waveshaper figures are listed in the <a href="#fx-disto2x-wslist">Double
distortion</a> section.</p>

<p class="var">Slew rate limiting, output</p>
<p>Slew rate limiter, after distortion.</p>

<p class="var">PSU overload</p>
<p>Enable or disable the simulation of overloaded power supply.
When overloaded, the signal is limited to what the PSU can supply.</p>

<p class="var">PSU load amount</p>
<p>Overload rate, in %.
When the overload is significant, the mains frequency modulates teh signal
and gives a distinct tone.</p>

<p class="var">PSU frequency</p>
<p>Mains frequency for the power supply, in Hz.
Usually this frequency is fixed (50 ou 60&#8239;Hz depending on the country),
but because of the modulation effect when the PSU is overloaded, it may be
interesting to tune it on a specific note.</p>

<p class="var">Low-pass filter cutoff frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency in Hz.
Attenuates the excess of high-frequency content generated by the
distortion.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-disto-tone"></a>Distortion Tone Stage</h3>

<p>This is a standard tone stack often found in distortion pedals, like
the DS-1 or Big Muff Pi.
It completes a pure distortion stage.
It is easier to setup than a complete parameteric equalizer.
It achieves a balance between the bass and the treble.</p>
<p>This kind of filter generally has a dip in the mids.
Here, it has been modified to add a mid level to change the filtering shape.
It is also possible to chose the filtering center frequency, which can be
used to mimic the settings of most pedals using this tone stack.</p>

<p class="var">Tone</p>
<p>Balances between the basses (low values) and trebles (high values).
50&#8239;% is balanced.</p>

<p class="var">Mid boost</p>
<p>Amplifies (positive values) or cut (negative values) the mid frequencies.
At 0, mids are neutral.
For the original circuit tone, use a value near &minus;75&#8239;%.</p>

<p class="var">Mid frequency</p>
<p>Selects the center frequency.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-disto2x"></a>Double Distortion</h3>

<p>This is a two-stage distortion.
Each stage is made of a low-cut filter, a bias, the distortion itself and
finally a high-cut filter.<p>
<p>But first, the sound is cut into two frequency bands.
The low band is not modified, and the high band is distorted.</p>
<p>It has also a system to adapt the volumes depending on the dynamics
and to modify the gain depending on the transients.<p>


<p class="var">Crossover freq</p>
<p>This is the frequency for the first split.
Thus, it is possible to let the lowest components unaltered for more
dynamics and clarity.</p>

<p class="var">LPF freq</p>
<p>Frequency for the initial low-pass filter (2nd order).</p>

<p class="var">Attack gain mod</p>
<p>This parameter sets how the attack transients modify the gain.
A positive value increases the gain on attacks, and a negative one reduces
it.</p>

<p class="var">Sustain gain mod</p>
<p>Sets how a release modifies the gain,
to prolongate or reduce the note sustain.
A positive value increases the gain when the note fades out.</p>

<p class="var">Stage 1/2 HPF freq</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter for stages 1 and 2.</p>

<p class="var">Stage 1/2 Bias</p>
<p>Bias for the stages 1 et 2.
When the bias is increased in absolute value, the distortion becomes more
asymetric and favor the even harmonics.
But beware, when the bias is too high, the signal can be cut, which gives
an effect of defective circuit.</p>

<p class="var">Stage 1/2 Type</p>
<p>Type of distortion for each stage.</p>

<p class="var">Stage 1/2 Gain</p>
<p>Distortion gain for each stage.</p>

<p class="var">Stage 1/2 LPF freq</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter applied after the distortion of
each stage.
This filter attenuates the harsh frequencies generated by the signal
shaping.</p>

<p class="var">Stage 1–2 mix</p>
<p>Mixes both stage outputs in the output signal.
The percentage is related to the second stage.</p>

<p class="var">Low band mix</p>
<p>Ratio fo the clean low band in the output.</p>

<p class="var">Density</p>
<p>Adjusts the output volume to the input volume.
A null value totally compensates the volume, and 100% keeps the distortion
untouched.
A low value gives more percussive and less natural sounds.</p>

<p class="var">Threshold</p>
<p>Threshold below which the volume is not reduced by the <var>Density</var>
parameter.</p>

<h3><a id="fx-env-fol"></a>Envelope Follower</h3>

<p>This effect is not an audio effect but a controller working by analysing
the incoming sound.
It can be inserted at any point in the processing chain, it will not modify
the sound.</p>
<p>The envelope follower detects the instantaneous sound volume and turns
it into a control signal.</p>

<p class="var">Attack time</p>
<p>Detection attack time.
This is the speed at which the envelope follows volume increases.</p>

<p class="var">Release time</p>
<p>Detection release time.
This is the speed at which the envelope follows volume decreases.</p>

<p class="var">Hold time</p>
<p>Time during which the detector holds its value after an attack, before
releasing.</p>

<p class="var">Gain</p>
<p>Multiplier applied to the control signal.</p>

<p class="var">Threshold</p>
<p>Threshold below which the output of the detector keeps quiet.
In logarithmic mode, the threshold is used as a floor value, with a minimum
of &minus;60&#8239;dB.</p>

<p class="var">Mode</p>
<p>Selects how the volume is turned into a control signal.
In linear mode, the raw volume value is directly used.
In logarithmic mode, this is a decibel value.
The range is set by the <var>Threshold</var> parameter.</p>

<p class="var">Clip envelope</p>
<p>Indicates that the control signal is limited to a maximum of 1.</p>

<p class="var">Clip source</p>
<p>Sets the level below which the source signal is clipped.
This parameters helps to neutralize the strongest attacks when the release
time is significant, limiting the induced delay between the actual peak
end and the envelope release.
When the parameter is set to the maximum, the clipping is deactivated.</p>

<p class="var">Low-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency for the low-cut filter.
This filter decreases the influence of the bass frequencies in the
detection, giving an envelope more reactive to guitar strums.
When set to the minimum, the filter is deactivated.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-filter-squeezer"></a>Filter Squeezer — Distorted resonant filter</h3>

<p>This is a very specific filter.
It is based on the famous Moog 4-pole low-pass filter, and heavily
modified.</p>
<p>It gives a sound ranging from something warm and vintage to something very
fuzzy via a defective radio or a feedback interference.
Some sounds are comparable to those obtained with the Fuzz Factory.</p>

<p class="var">Frequency</p>
<p>Filter cutoff frequency.
This parameter is automatically assigned to the expression pedal.</p>

<p class="var">Resonance</p>
<p>Resonance of the filter, occurring slightly below the cutoff frequency.
The highest values put the filter in self-oscillation.</p>

<p class="var">Color</p>
<p>The color setting influences the destructive and fuzz aspect of the
filter.</p>

<p class="var">Drive</p>
<p>Adjusts the input level.
The filter being very sensitive to the input signal volume, one can obtain
very varied sonority by changing this parameter.
The inverse gain is applied at output, limited between &minus;12 and
0&#8239;dB.
It can also be wise to place in front of a compressor with strong settings
to obtain something somewhat predictable and reproducible.</p>

<p class="var">Foldback</p>
<p>Activates different types of internal distortion.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-flancho"></a>FlanCho — Chorus and flanger</h3>

<p>It is a relatively classical chorus/flanger.
It can generate a stereo signal from a mono input.</p>
<p>The effect works by adding a slightly delayed version of itself to the main
signal.
The delay continuously varies which creates tone fluctuations.</p>
<p>The chorus is characterized by a significant delay time
(around 20&#8239;ms) and a low depth.
For a flanger, a high depth, a short delay time and a minimum feedback are
preferable.</p>

<p class="var">Speed</p>
<p>Speed of the oscillations of the delay time.</p>

<p class="var">Depth</p>
<p>Amplitude of the oscillations of the delay time.
At most, these vary between 0 or almost <var>Delay</var>&times;2.
The tonal change is then very pronounced.</p>

<p class="var">Delay</p>
<p>Average delay time.</p>

<p class="var">Feedback</p>
<p>Feedback ratio of the delayed signal.
Values close to 100&#8239;% can alter significantly the volume.
Negative values give a more metallic sound than the positive ones.</p>

<p class="var">Waveform type</p>
<p>Shape of the oscillations for the delay time.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Sine</span></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Triangle</span></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Parabola</span></td><td>Parabola</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Inv.para</span></td><td>Inverse parabola</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Ramp up</span></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Ramp down</span></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Random</span></td><td>Sine with random variations</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Waveform shape</p>
<p>How the waveforme is deformed.
At 0&#8239;%, it keeps the orignal shape.
Otherwise, it is saturated by the bottom or by the top.
It emphasise the longest or shortest time delays.</p>

<p class="var">Number of voices</p>
<p>It is possible to have 1 to 4 chorus/flanger voices simultaneously,
for a more or less thick sound.
The delay oscillations of each voice are not synchronized with the
others.</p>

<p class="var">Phase set</p>
<p>Allows the phase of oscillations to be set manually, in degrees.
This parameter allows on the one hand to act on the tone of the effect by
associating for example a pedal (expression or not).
On the other hand, it provides reproducible sound.
Indeed, when the program is activated, the phase is automatically set to the
value given by this parameter.</p>

<p class="var">Dry input</p>
<p>Indicates that the input signal is mixed with the output signal.
If we want a ratio different of 50–50&#8239;%, one can put this parameter on
<span class="ui">Off</span> and use the <var>Effect mix</var> parameter.
When the original signal is totally missing and there is no feedback,
the obtained effect is a vibrato.</p>

<p class="var">Mix mode</p>
<p>Select whether the delayed signal is added to or subtracted from the
original signal.
<span class="ui">Add</span> causes an amplification of the low frequencies
with a very short delay time, whereas <span class="ui">Sub</span> cuts
them.</p>

<p class="var">Oversampling rate</p>
<p>Oversampling rate for the processing.
When set to <span class="ui">&times;4</span>, shortest delay time can be
achieved (a tenth of microseconds) when <var>Depth</var> is close to
100&#8239;%, which can be useful for devastating flangers.
However, it eats more CPU resource.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-freeverb"></a>Freeverb — Reverberation</h3>

<p>This effect implements
<a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Freeverb.html">Freeverb</a>,
a Schroeder reverberator which coefficients have been carefully tweaked.
It has been designed by Jezar at Dreampoint and released in the public domain.
The effect is able to generate a stereo signal.</p>

<p class="var">Reflectivity</p>
<p>This parameter is the reverberation time.
The higher, the more reflective are the simulated walls, and the longer the
reverberation.
This time is also dependent on the <var>Damping</var>.</p>

<p class="var">Damping</p>
<p>Specifies at which point the high frequencies are attenuated during the
reverberation.</p>

<p class="var">Level wet</p>
<p>Level of the reverberated signal in the effect output.</p>

<p class="var">Level dry</p>
<p>Level of the original signal in the effect outpout.</p>

<p class="var">Width</p>
<p>Stereo spread of the effect.
At 0&#8239;%, the reverberation is completely mono, and completely stereo at
100&#8239;%.
Note: both channels are always processed independantly, like two mono
reverberations.
The parameter only controls the output mixing.</p>

<p class="var">Mode</p>
<p>When the mode <span class="ui">Freeze</span> is activated, the input
of the reverberation is cut and the reverberated sound is frozen.
It can be interresting to link this parameter to a footswitch.</p>

<p class="var">Low cut</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency of the low-cut filter on the reverberation output.</p>

<p class="var">High cut</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency of the high-cut filter on the reverberation output.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-freq-shift"></a>Frequency Shifter</h3>

<p>This is a pretty simple effect that shifts all the frequencies of the sound.
As the frequencies are added and not multiplied, the harmonic ratios are lost
and the sound becomes atonal or inharmonic, approaching a bell sound.
However, when the shift frequency falls on a specific note, some linked notes
(octave, fifth, quarte...) start to sound right again and take a very special
color.</p>
<p>The frequency translator looks like the ring modulator, but it does not
reflect the spectral image as is the case for the latter.</p>

<p class="var">Frequency</p>
<p>Shiftig frequency, in Hz.
It can be negative or positive.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-freq-split"></a>Frequency Splitter</h3>

<p>This effect splits the sound frequency spectrum into two parts.
There are two outputs.
The spectral part below the cutoff frequency is sent to the first output, and
the part above on the second output.</p>
<p>A 5th order filter splits the spectrum.
Both parts can be mixed together without any loss nor phasing issue.</p>

<p class="var">Cutoff frequency</p>
<p>The cutoff frequency, in Hz.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-tremolo-harm"></a>Harmonic Tremolo — Two-band tremolo</h3>

<p>This is a variation of the <a href="#fx-tremolo">tremolo</a>
effect found in old Fender Brownface amplifiers.
The sound is divided into two bands, bass and treble.
The two bands are modulated in amplitude by two opposite signals from the LFO.
The sound alternates between treble and bass.</p>

<p class="var">Speed</p>
<p>Oscillation speed, in Hz.</p>

<p class="var">Amount</p>
<p>Amount of oscillations.
At 100&#8239;%, the modulated sound is silent on the lowest part of the LFO.
It is possible to go far beyond this value in order to create a harder effect,
sounding like a gate.</p>

<p class="var">Bass</p>
<p>Amplitude of the LFO signal used to modulate the bass frequencies.
At 0, the sound is not modulated.</p>

<p class="var">Treble</p>
<p>Amplitude of the LFO signal used to modulate the treble.
At 0, the sound is not modulated.
The best results are obtained when the amplitudes of the bass and treble
are of opposite signs.</p>

<p class="var">Cutoff frequency</p>
<p>Split frequency between the bass and the treble, in Hz.</p>

<p class="var">Gain saturation</p>
<p>Indicates to what extent the positive parts of the LFO should be saturated
in order to avoid exaggerated volume rise when <var>Amount</var> takes high
values.</p>

<p class="var">Bias</p>
<p>Offset to apply to the values generated by the LFO to shift its curve in
the low or high amplitudes.
This creates a more or less dense sound, especially when <var>Amount</var> is
high.
In this case, the tremolo behaves like a gate and this parameter allows to set
its opening time.</p>

<p class="var">Tone</p>
<p>Allows you to adjust the ratio between bass and treble.
Negative values reduce high frequencies and positive values reduce low
frequencies.</p>

<p class="var">Stereo</p>
<p>When the effect output is stereo, this parameter widens the stereo image,
especially when the source is mono.
Modulation is done with an opposite sign on both channels.
Be careful, if the sound goes back to mono later, the effect is lost.</p>

<p class="var">Waveform, Sample and hold, Smoothing, Chaos amount, Phase
distortion amount, Phase distortion offset, Sign, Variation 1, Variation 2,
Phase set</p>
<p>These parameters are identical to the ones from the
<a href="#fx-lfo">LFO</a>.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-hypercomb"></a>Hypercomb — Polyphonic comb filter</h3>

<p>This effects adds a metallic reverberating texture, as if the sound was
played through a pipe.
Thus, it becomes pitched, and it is possible to tune the pitch on one or more
notes (up to 8).</p>
<p>Additionally, each voice has a filter within its feedback loop.
It can resonate (allowing self-oscillation) and cut the high frequencies.</p>

<p class="var">Tune</p>
<p>Global transpose for all the voices, in semitones.</p>

<p class="var">Duration</p>
<p>Approximate duration of the reverberating tail.
This is the time to reach &minus;60&#8239;dB (RT60).</p>

<p class="var">Volume</p>
<p>Global voice volume, in dB.</p>

<p class="var">Filter frequency</p>
<p>Filter cutoff frequency.
It affects the resonant peak as well as the high shelf.</p>

<p class="var">Filter resonance</p>
<p>Peak resonance amount.
When set high, the voice self-oscillates.
When the resonance is active, the time given by the <var>Duration</var>
parameter becomes more approximate.</p>

<p class="var">Filter damping</p>
<p>Damping level for the high frequencies, above <var>Filter
frequency</var>.</p>

<p class="var">Voice 1–8 polarity</p>
<p>Comb feedback polarity for the given voice.
This parameter can take three values:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Off</span></td><td>Voice is deactivated (mute).</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Pos</span></td><td>Positive feedback. This mode gives a clear and bright sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Neg</span></td><td>Negative feedback. The pitched effect is less pronounced.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Voice 1–8 duration multiplier</p>
<p>Multiplier for the duration given by <var>Duration</var>.
This parameter allows different durations for each voice.</p>

<p class="var">Voice 1–8 gain</p>
<p>Relative voice volume, in dB.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-imp-fix"></a>Input Impedance Fix</h3>

<p>This effect allows to correct the input impedance of the sound card, which
can be a bit low, resulting in a slight attenuation of the treble.
It is a simple first-order linear high-shelf filter.</p>
<p>The effect should be calibrated using an amp with a setting as transparent
as possible (clear sound, no equalization).
Then we compare the sound of the guitar directly connected with the one coming
from the pedalboard with just this effect.</p>

<p class="var">Cutoff frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency.</p>

<p class="var">Level</p>
<p>Treble amplification level.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-lipidipi"></a>Lipidipi — Fat ensemble effect</h3>

<p>Lipidipi fattens the sound by adding weight, as if several instruments
played together simultaneously.</p>
<p>The effect works a bit like a chorus, but the sound is less typical and
possibly more functional.
It generates groups of 4 replicas of the original signal, slightly detuned.
Each group is filtered to occupy its own frequency band, in order to break the
harmonic relationships between the partials.
The crossover frequencies range from 100&#8239;Hz to 3200&#8239;Hz.</p>

<p class="var">Fat</p>
<p>Sets the number of replica groups.
The more groups, the more the effect become transparent, going further from
a typical chorus tone.
However, the CPU usage increases consequently.</p>

<p class="var">Grease</p>
<p>Sets the maximum detuning for the replicas, in cents of semi-tones.
The greater the detuning, the more pronounced the effect.</p>

<p class="var">Suet</p>
<p>Sets the mix between the original signal and the replicas.
There is no specific unit.
45&#8239;% gives similar weights to both types of signals.</p>

<p class="var">Lard</p>
<p>Enables stereo processing.
In stereo, each channel is processed independently of the other.
It gives more spatiality to the effect for a mono source, but may break the
phase consistency on a stereo source.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-midside"></a>Mid Side Coder</h3>

<p>This effect, usually working on a bi-channel source, can encode or decode
mid-side signals.</p>
<p>It is also possible to swap the left and right channels as well as invert
their polarity.
The polarity inversion is done before swapping them, if both operations are
enabled.
When coding or decoding, these auxiliary operations are always done on the
stereo side of the coding, not on the mid-side channels.</p>

<p class="var">Operation</p>
<p>Selects which operation is done&#8239;:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">None</span></td><td>No specific coding</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">St->MS</span></td><td>Stereo to mid-side encoding</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">MS->St</span></td><td>Mid-side to stereo decoding</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Channel swap</p>
<p>Swaps the left and right channels.</p>

<p class="var">Left polarity</p>
<p>Invert the left channel polarity.</p>

<p class="var">Right polarity</p>
<p>Invert the right channel polarity.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-moogflt"></a>Moog Filter — Self-oscillating resonant filter</h3>

<p>This is a realistic recreation of 4-pole Moog filter, with an audio-rate
cutoff frequency modulation possibility.
The filter has two inputs, the first one is the main filter input, and the
other one can be used as a sidechain to modulate the cutoff frequency.</p>

<p class="var">Mode</p>
<p>This is the filter type derived from the original Moog filter.
One can obtain different filter modes by mixing the signals taken from
different stages of the original filter.
The following modes are available&#8239;:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">LP4</span></td><td>4-pole low-pass. Original filter.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">LP2</span></td><td>2-pole low-pass</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">BP4</span></td><td>4-pole band-pass</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">BP2</span></td><td>2-pole band-pass</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">HP4</span></td><td>4-pole high-pass</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">HP2</span></td><td>2-pole high-pass</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">N4</span></td><td>4-pole notch</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">N2</span></td><td>2-pole notch</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">N2X</span></td><td>Double 2-pole notch, 2-octave spaced</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">PK</span></td><td>Resonant peak</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Variant</p>
<p>Sets the variant in the feedback processing, enabling threshold effects.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Standard</span></td><td>Normal feedback</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Quantize</span></td><td>Quantization</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Flip</span></td><td>Values falling in a certain range are inverted</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Cutoff frequency</p>
<p>This is the cutoff frequceny, in Hz.
When the resonance is strong (above about 95&#8239;%), the filter gets out of
tune.</p>

<p class="var">Resonance</p>
<p>Sets the resonance level.
From 100&#8239;% and above, the filter self-oscillates.</p>

<p class="var">DC gain compensation</p>
<p>This parameter keeps constant the output volume for the bass frequencies,
whatever the resonance level.
Indeed, with the original filter, increasing the resonance lowers the bass
frequency response.</p>

<p class="var">Side chain FM</p>
<p>Activates the cutoff frequency modulation by the second input.</p>

<p class="var">Side chain FM amplitude</p>
<p>Sets the modulation depth from the second input.
When this amplitude is 0&#8239;dB, a unit more or less shifts the cutoff
frequency up or down of about one octave.</p>

<p class="var">Self-FM</p>
<p>Activates the cutoff frequency self-modulation.
This functionality connects the filter output to its frequency control.</p>

<p class="var">Self-FM amplitude</p>
<p>Sets the self-modulation amplitude.
This is the amount of signal modulating the cutoff frequency.
It is internally clipped to ±1 octave.</p>

<p class="var">Self-FM low-pass filter frequency</p>
<p>Sets the frequency of the low-pass filter that is located between the
main filter output and the cutoff control.
This filters helps to remove the excess of high frequencies.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-nzbl"></a>Noise Bleach — Noise gate</h3>

<p>Noise Bleach is a kind of noise gate.
It splits the input signal spectrum into adjacent frequency bands covering the
entire audible spectrum.
The sound on each band passes only if it is above a certain threshold.</p>
<p>To adjust the device, you need the noise without any other “useful” sound.
Start by setting the global level to &minus;100&#8239;dB.
Then, for each band, gradually raise its threshold.
Stop when sound changes and noise is actually removed.
Do not go further, this would be harmful for the audio content.</p>
<p>Repeat on as many bands as necessary.
If required, balance the global level with the single band levels.</p>

<p class="var">Global level</p>
<p>This is the overall filter rejection level, to be adapted according to the
noise level.
All filter levels are scaled according to this parameter.
Usual values are in the &minus;100&#8239;dB range.</p>

<p class="var">Band x-y level</p>
<p>Relative filter threshold for the specified frequency range, in dB.
At &minus;&infin;, the band filter is disabled.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-nzcl"></a>Noise Chlorine — Noise gate</h3>

<p>Noise Chlorine is a kind of noise gate, similar to
<a href="#fx-nzbl">Noise Bleach</a>.
It consists of a series of notch filters that reject the target signal only
below a certain threshold.
For example the 50 or 60&#8239;Hz from the mains and its harmonics.
But it can also be used as a broadband noise filter as a cheap alternative to
<a href="#fx-nzbl">Noise Bleach</a>.</p>

<p>To adjust the device, you need the noise without any other “useful” sound.
Start by setting the global level to &minus;100&#8239;dB.
Then, for each band, select a frequency (intuitively).
We can start with a selectivity of 0.5 which is broad enough to start
with.</p>
<p>Gradually raise the band threshold.
Stop when sound changes and noise is actually removed.
Do not go further, this would be harmful for the audio content.
Then adjust the frequency and selectivity as needed.
If the noise is spread over a large part of the spectrum, the selectivity can
be kept low by spacing all bands by one octave.</p>
<p>Repeat on as many bands as necessary.
If required, balance the global level with the single band levels.</p>

<p class="var">Global level</p>
<p>This is the overall filter rejection level, to be adapted according to the
noise level.
All notch filter levels are scaled according to this parameter.
Usual values are in the &minus;100&#8239;dB range.</p>

<p class="var">Notch 1–8 frequency</p>
<p>Notch filter cutoff frequency, in Hz.</p>

<p class="var">Notch 1–8 selectivity (Q)</p>
<p>Filter selectivity.
The higher the selectivity, the thinner the filtered band.</p>

<p class="var">Notch 1–8 level</p>
<p>Relative filter threshold for the specified frequency range, in dB.
At &minus;&infin;, the band filter is disabled.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-onsetdetector"></a>Onset detector</h3>

<p>This effect is not an audio effect but a controller working by analysing
the incoming sound.
It can be inserted at any point in the processing chain, it will not modify
the sound.</p>
<p>It can detect the beginning and the end of notes or chords and turn this
information into a control signal to modulate other effets.
It is actually very simple and can handle only one note or chord at a
time.
Actually, it’s more a strum and silence detector.</p>
<p>There are two output signals:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Attack signal.
Takes a value &gt; 0 if an attack is detected, 0 otherwise.
The value is related to the detected velocity.</li>
<li>Release signal.
1 if a release is detected, 0 otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: the detector can exhibit a few milliseconds of latency.</p>

<p class="var">Velocity clipping</p>
<p>Indicates if the detected note velocity should be clipped to a maximum of
1.</p>

<p class="var">Attack threshold</p>
<p>Minimum level for an attack to be detected, in dB.
The lower, the more sensitive.</p>

<p class="var">Attack ratio</p>
<p>Volume increase to detect an attack, in percent.
The lower, the more sensitive, but can lead to more false triggers.</p>

<p class="var">Release threshold</p>
<p>Maximum level for a release to be detected, in dB.
The higher, the more sensitive.</p>

<p class="var">Release ratio</p>
<p>Volume decrease to detect a release, in percent.
The lower, the more sensitive, but can lead to unexpected note ends.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-peq"></a>Parametric Equalizer</h3>

<p>It is a classic 4-, 8- or 16-band parametric equalizer (depending on the
selected option).
Each band is made of a second-order filter.</p>

<p class="var">Band 1/2/3/4 Type</p>
<p>Filter type for the band:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Peak</span></td><td>Bell curve. Boosts or cuts the area around the frequency.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Low&nbsp;shelf</span></td><td>Low-frequency shelf. The reference frequency is the middle of the transition between the main part and the shelf.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">High&nbsp;Pass</span></td><td>High-pass filter</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">High&nbsp;shelf</span></td><td>High-frequency shelf</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Low&nbsp;Pass</span></td><td>Low-pass filter</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Band 1/2/3/4 Frequency</p>
<p>Band refrence frequency.</p>

<p class="var">Band 1/2/3/4 Q</p>
<p>Band selectivity or quality factor.
For the bell filter, the higher <var>Q</var>, the thinner the bell.
For shelves, the higher <var>Q</var>, the steeper the slope.
But if <var>Q</var>&gt;0.71, a resonance and a notch start to show at both
ends of the shelves.
Same with the high- and low-pass filters, with a resonance only.</p>

<p class="var">Speed</p>
<p>Oscillation speed.</p>

<p class="var">Mix</p>
<p>Ratio of phased signal in the final mix.</p>

<p class="var">Feedback</p>
<p>Amount of feedback from the phased signal.
The higher the feedback, the more pronounced the effect.</p>

<p>Order for the phasing filter.</p>

<p class="var">Minimum frequency</p>
<p>Minimum cutoff frequency for the phasing filter, in Hz.
The oscillator make the filter cutoff frequency vary between the minimum and
maximum frequencies.</p>

<p class="var">Maximum frequency</p>
<p>Maximum cutoff frequency for the phasing filter, in Hz.
By putting the maximum frequency at the same value as the minimum frequency,
it is possible to stop the oscillation and to use the phaser as fixed filter
for coloring the sound.</p>

<p class="var">Feedback source</p>
<p>Number of the stage from which the feedback signal is taken.</p>

<p class="var">Waveform, Sample and hold, Smoothing, Chaos amount, Phase

<p>These parameters are identical to the ones from the
<a href="#fx-lfo">LFO</a>.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-phaserht"></a>Phaser HT</h3>

<p>This modulation effect works a little differently from phasers
but uses the same principles.
However, it has a very typical sound.
It can generate a stereo signal from a mono input.</p>
<p>An optional band-pass filter allows the selection of a range of
frequencies to be kept from the phased sound.
This essentially makes it possible to limit the low frequencies when the
settings are a bit strong.</p>
<p>It is also possible to obtain a “barberpole phaser” effect, which gives the
impression of having tones that go up or down endlessly.<p>

<p class="var">Speed</p>
<p>Oscillation speed.</p>

<p class="var">Depth</p>
<p>This is the number of stage of the phaser, amongst
<span class="ui">4</span>, <span class="ui">8</span>,
<span class="ui">16</span> et <span class="ui">32</span>.
The number of stages changes the general sound color.
The larger, the greater the number of notches.</p>

<p class="var">Feedback level</p>
<p>Amount of signal fed back to the phaser input.
This feedback is saturated, so it may be interesting to push the input signal
level a little to enrich the result.</p>

<p class="var">Feedback color</p>
<p>Changes the feedback tone color.</p>

<p class="var">Phase mix</p>
<p>Amount of phase-shifted signal added to the original signal.
Adding both is what produces the phasing effect.
This effect is maximum at 50&#8239;%.</p>

<p class="var">Phase offset</p>
<p>This parameter allows the phase of the oscillations to be moved relative to
its natural cycle.</p>

<p class="var">Phase set</p>
<p>Manually sets the phase of oscillations, in degrees.
It is interesting to modulate this parameter with an external LFO in frozen
mode.
It gives an oscillating effect closer to a conventional phaser.</p>

<p class="var">Hold</p>
<p>Freezes the phaser oscillations.</p>

<p class="var">BPF freq</p>
<p>Middle band-pass filter frequency, for the phased signal.</p>

<p class="var">BPF selectivity</p>
<p>Selects more or less accurately a band of frequencies with the band-pass
filter.
When this parameter is minimum, the filtering is deactivated.</p>

<p class="var">Direction</p>
<p>Direction of the oscillations on the left channel.
<span class="ui">Down</span> makes the notches go down,
and <span class="ui">Up</span> makes them go up.</p>

<p class="var">Mono phase mix</p>
<p>Specifies how the phase-shifted signal should be mixed with the main signal
when the output is mono.
<span class="ui">Left</span> uses only one of both signals, leading to a tone
going always in the same direction indicated by <var>Direction</var>.
<span class="ui">Mixed</span> mixes both signals going up and down, producing
a kind of oscillation.</p>

<p class="var">Stereo phase mix</p>
<p>Indicates how the phased signal should be processed when the effect output
is stereo.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Spat&nbsp;mix</span></td><td>Input channels are mixed before being phased.
The spectral notches in the left and right channels sweep in opposite directions, which gives a strong stereo image, including with a mono input signal.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Spat&nbsp;sep</span></td><td>Like <span class="ui">Spat mix</span>, but the input channels are processed independently.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Bi-mono</span></td><td>Left and right channels are processed independantly and use the <var>Mono phase mix</var> setting to specify the direction of the notch sweeps.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">All-pass delay</p>
<p>This parameter allows to introduce a kind of complementary micro-delay in
the phase-shifted signal.
This increases the number of sweeping notches in the spectrum.
The spectral distribution of these notches is guided by the <var>All-pass
coefficient</var> value.</p>

<p class="var">All-pass coefficient</p>
<p>Coefficient of the phase-shift filters used to achieve a micro-delay.
At 0, the filter behaves like a pure delay.
A negative value groups the notches on the bottom of the spectrum, and a
positive value on the top.
When the coefficient is &minus;0.5, with a delay of about 700&#8239;µs and a
low value for <var>Depth</var>, the notch distribution is almost harmonic,
which makes it possible to obtain an audio illusion similar to the
Sherpard-Risset.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-pitchdetector"></a>Pitch Detector</h3>

<p>This effect is not an audio effect but a controller working by analysing
the incoming sound.
It can be inserted at any point in the processing chain, it will not modify
the sound.</p>
<p>The pitch detector can retrieve the pitch of the played note and turn it
into a control signal to modulate other effects.
It work only on monophonic, pitched sounds.
Chords and non-pitched sounds are not supported.</p>

<p class="var">Minimum frequency</p>
<p>Minimum detected frequency, in Hz.
Any note below this frequency will be ignored.
This parameter impacts the processing power taken by the effect.</p>

<p class="var">Maximum frequency</p>

<h3><a id="fx-platitude"></a>Platitude — Plate reverberator</h3>

<p>Platitude is an algorithmic plate reverberator, which was described by
Jon Dattorro in 1997.
It is also capable of shimmer effect, that is change the pitch of the sound
circulating in the reverberation tail, giving the impression that the tone
keeps going up or down.</p>

<p class="var">Dry level</p>
<p>Level of the unprocessed sound in the final mix, in dB.</p>

<p class="var">Early reflection level</p>
<p>The level of the early reflections in the final mix, in dB.
This is the sound that reflected only a few times within the room before
reaching the listener’s ears.
They are like very short echoes following shortly the direct sound.</p>

<p class="var">Diffuse field level</p>
<p>Level of the diffuse field in the final mix, in dB.
This is all the complex, rich and numerous reflections occuring after the
early ones.
It gives the typical diffuse sound of the reverberation tail.</p>

<p class="var">Predelay time</p>
<p>This is an additional delay between the source sound and the reverberation
process.
The shorter, the further the sound appears (with levels set to suitable
values).</p>

<p class="var">Number of taps</p>
<p>This is the number of individual echoes forming the early reflections.
These echoes are randomly spread in time.
Their volume is also randomly chosen, following a curve decaying with
time.</p>

<p class="var">Early reflection duration</p>
<p>This is the duration in milliseconds between the first and last echoes of
the early reflections.</p>

<p class="var">Early reflection decay</p>
<p>This is the level in dB of the last early reflection, relative to the first
one.</p>

<p class="var">Early reflection stereo depth</p>
<p>This percentage indicate how stereo the early reflections will sound.
The lower, the more the left and right echoes will tend to be identical.
The higher, the more independently the echoes are spread between both
channels.</p>

<p class="var">Input low-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency for the low-cut (or high-pass) filter at the input of the
“tank” generating the diffuse field.
Cutting at tens or hundreds of Hz make the sound lighter and less muffled
in presence of heavy content in the lower part of the spectrum.</p>

<p class="var">Input high-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency for the high-cut (or low-pass) filter at the input of the
tank.
Cutting the high avoids the reverberation to have more presence than
required for mixing purpose.</p>

<p class="var">Input diffusion</p>
<p>Before recirculating in the tank, the sound is pre-diffused.
This rate indicates at which point.</p>

<p class="var">Decay coefficient</p>
<p>This is the tank feedback coefficient.
The closer to 1, the longer the diffuse field will last, giving the impression
of a large space.
Beware when this coefficient reaches 1 without filtering nor transposition,
the sound will accumulate indefinitely and never decay.</p>

<p class="var">Room size</p>
<p>This ratio (percent) indicates how big the room is, relatively to its
original dimensions.
Like <var>Decay</var>, this coefficient allows changing the reverberation tail
duration.
However it works by lengthening or shortening the internal delay lines.
When this coefficient is very low, it is possible that the transposition
functions may be attenuated or altered.</p>

<p class="var">Pitch shift</p>
<p>This is the number of cents (of a semi-tone) of transposition applied
during each loop of the sound in the tank.
The tone rise or fall speed is also influenced by the <var>Room size</var>
parameter.</p>

<p class="var">Pitch shift mode</p>
<p>This parameter indicates if the transposition affect a single delay
line (<span class="ui">Single</span>) or all of them at the same time
(<span class="ui">Multi</span>).
In the latter case, the parameter is internally adapted to match the
<span class="ui">Single</span> mode.
It gives a smoother but blurrier transposition.</p>

<p class="var">Tank low-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency for the low-cut (or high-pass) filter located in the
reverberation tank.</p>

<p class="var">Tank high-cut frequency</p>
<p>Cutoff frequency for the high-cut (or low-pass) tank filter.
The sound is processed by the filter at each loop, transforming it
progressively.
Room walls are often absoring high frequencies, leading to their progressive
attenuation, before the lower part of the spectrum.
This filter simulates this behaviour.</p>

<p class="var">Tank diffusion</p>
<p>This ratio sets how the tank makes the sound diffuse.
When set to 0, the tank sounds like short regenerating echoes.</p>

<p class="var">Freeze</p>
<p>When this state is set, the tank is frozen and the reverberation sounds
fixed in time.
More specifically&#8239;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tank input is cut and silent.</li>
<li>The <var>Decay</var> is internally set to 1, making the sound circulating almost infinitely.</li>
<li>The filter is bypassed, becoming neutral.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters come back to their original values as soon as the freeze
state is deactivated.
The pitch shift is still working in frozen mode.
Same for the diffusion, causing very slight losses in the sound.
After a few minutes, a slight loss of volume can become apparent.</p>

<p class="var">Flush</p>
<p>This parameter, when switched from off to on, flushes the tank delay lines,
making them silent.
This allows to take back control when the effect is becoming wild, or more
simply, to create specific rythmic effects.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-distpwm"></a>Pulse Width Modulation Distortion</h3>

<p>This is an almost infinite-gain distortion, the output signal is
rectangular.
Only the rising wave fronts are taken from the input signal.
Downward wave fronts are generated automatically after a fixed period of time,
which gives the sound a “PWM oscillator” color, like with a synthesizer.</p>

<p class="var">Pulse width</p>
<p>Pulse duration, in milliseconds.
The shorter the duration, the more filled the sound spectrum is, especially
in high frequencies, and the lower the apparent volume.
The parameter is automatically mapped to the expression pedal.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-distpwm2"></a>Pulse Width Modulation Distortion 2</h3>

<p>This effect is an improvement over the PWM Distortion 1.
It generates waves for multiple octaves, offers serveral waveforms and an
envelope control with sustain and gate settings.</p>
<p>There are 4 voices, or oscillators (or octaves):</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Standard</span></td><td>This is the normal channel,
pulse are generated on rising edges.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Double</span></td><td>Pulse are generated on rising
and falling edges, but this is not exactly an octave-doubler.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Sub 1</span></td><td>Pulse are generated every 2
rising edges, lowering the tone from one octave.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Sub 2</span></td><td>Pulse are generated every 4
rising edges, lowering the tone from two octaves.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Pre-filter</p>
<p>There is a combination of low-pass and high-pass filters at the input to tame
harmonics and remove DC components.
This parameters allows to select the stength of the filtering.
With strong filtering, the resulting wave is cleaner, but sustain may be
shorter on the higher notes.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Weak</span></td><td>2-pole low-pass filtering at 1.5&#8239;kHz</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Mild</span></td><td>Additional LPF at 500&#8239;Hz and 5&#8239;Hz HPF</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Strong</span></td><td>Additional LPF cutoff frequency
is lowered to 50&#8239;Hz</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Detection method</p>
<p>Selects which method is used to detect the edges and trigger the
pulses.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">0-X</span></td><td>The zero-crossing method gives a
rich content, especially with chords, but is quite sensitive to octave
errors.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Peak</span></td><td>The peak method sounds more like
a monophonic pitch tracking and is very clean and stable.
However sometimes it may output short gaps of silence, and sounds poor on
chords.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Threshold</p>
<p>For the zero-crossing detection method, it sets the level (in dB) to cross to
detect a wave edge.
The lower, the longer the sustain, but the more sensitive to noise.
Using a strong pre-filter may require to lower the threshold.</p>

<p class="var">Density</p>
<p>Adjusts the output volume to the input volume.
A null value totally compensates the volume, and 100&#8239;% keeps the
distortion untouched.
A low value gives more percussive and less natural sounds.</p>

<p class="var">Sustain level</p>
<p>When the volume is compensated by the <var>Density</var> parameter, it
sets a level (in dB) below which the volume stops reducing.
It is useful to keep only the attacks from the original sound while keeping
the sustain of a high-gain distortion.</p>

<p class="var">Gate level</p>
<p>Level in dB below which the output sound is cut.
This helps to counter clicks and pops appearing when the input volume is
low and dominated by noise.</p>

<p class="var">Pulse type</p>
<p>For a give oscillator, selects which type of waveform is triggered when an
edge is detected in the input.
Singles pulses sound like PWM synthesis, whereas continuous waveform sound
like sync-oscillators.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Rect</span></td><td>This is the original waveform,
just a single square pulse. It has a powerful sound a rich harmonic content.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Ramp</span></td><td>A single rising sawtooth.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Cycle</span></td><td>A single sine-like cycle.
Harmonic content is low, it gives a softer sound.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Sine</span></td><td>A continuous sine-like waveform.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Saw</span></td><td>A continuous sawtooth waveform.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Level</p>
<p>Volume in dB of the selected oscillator.</p>

<p class="var">Pulse frequency</p>
<p>Pulse frequency of the selected oscillator, in Hz (equivalent to twice
the pulse duration in the original PWM Distortion).
The highest the frequency, the more filled the sound spectrum is, especially
in the high part of the spectrum, but the lower the apparent volume with
single pulses.</p>

<h3><a id="fx-sgirlz"></a>SiemensGirlz — Creative delay</h3>

<p>SiemensGirlz is a relatively complex creative delay effect for obtaining a wide variety of sounds, especially when the parameters are modulated by LFOs.</p>
<pThe sound passes through 4 taps, kind of simple echoes without repetition.
The four taps and the original signal feed a reverb.
This reverberated signal enters one or two feedback delay lines.
Effects can be applied to the delayed signal and fed back.

<ul>
<li>Resonant filter</li>

<li>High-shelf filter</li>
<li>Frequency shifter</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a ducking system attenuates or mutes the output of the
feedback lines according to the volume of the input, for example to improve
the clarity of the original sound while keeping the delay effect when the
input is silent.</p>

<h3><a id="fx-wah"></a>Wah-wah</h3>

<p>It is a wah-wah effect more or less modelled on the Cry Baby pedal.
The range for the cutoff frequencies has been extended, which makes it
possible to obtain a devastating sound in the low frequencies.</p>

<p class="var">Frequency</p>
<p>Filter cutoff frequency.
This parameter is linked by default to the expression pedal.
To get the sound of a classic wah pedal, reduce the interval to about
400–1600&#8239;Hz.</p>

<p class="var">Selectivity</p>
<p>Filter resonance.
The higher the value, the more coloured the filter, generating a distinct
tone.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-wah2"></a>Wah-wah (Cry Baby)</h3>

<p>This effect is a precise emulation of different Cry Baby wah-wah models.
The modeling of these pedals and the resulting algorithm were written by
<a href="http://cackleberrypines.net/transmogrifox/src/bela/inductor_wah_C_src">Transmogrifox</a>.</p>

<p class="var">Position</p>
<p>Position of the pedal, which corresponds to the cutoff frequency of the
filter.
This parameter is linked by default to the expression pedal.</p>

<p class="var">Type</p>
<p>Selects the Cry Baby model.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-adsr"></a>ADSR — Control envelope</h3>

<p>This effect is only available in the control signal generator category
since it does not process any audio signals, either input or output.
It generates an ADSR envelope, following some control parameters.</p>
<p>An ADSR is often used to control the evolution of an audio synthesis
parameter during a note: volume, filter cutoff, etc.
It is composed of 4 segments, played one after another:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ui">Attack</span>: the envelope rises from 0 to its nominal
value (100&#8239;%) after the note beginning (Note On).</li>
<li><span class="ui">Decay</span>: occurs after the attack section.
It leads the envelope to its sustain value.</li>
<li><span class="ui">Sustain</span>: this section controls the envelope
evolution when the note is hold.
The envelope drops slowly to 0 at a speed programmed by the sustain time.
When the latter is infinite, the envelope holds the sustain value until a
new note event occurs.</li>
<li><span class="ui">Release</span>: The envelope can run this section at
any time, as soon as the played note is stopped (Note Off).
This section allows the envelope to return to 0 at a controlled speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shape of each segement is of “RC load” type, mimicing the analogue
synthesisers envelopes.</p>
<p>Usually, <var>Trigger On</var> and <var>Trigger Off</var>are mapped on
external events.</p>

<p class="var">Trigger On</p>
<p>When this parameter is set to a non-null value, the envelope generator
is fed with a Note On event.
The parameter value also gives the note velocity.</p>

<p class="var">Trigger Off</p>
<p>When this parameter is set to a non-null value, the envelope generator
is fed with a Note Off event.</p>

<p class="var">Amplitude</p>
<p>Overall envelope amplitude.</p>

<p class="var">Velocity sensitivity</p>
<p>This indicates a which point the envelope follows the note velocity
given by the <var>Trigger On</var> parameter.
At 0&#8239;%, velocity is ignored.
At 100&#8239;%, the envelope is fully scaled with the velocity.</p>

<p class="var">Attack time</p>
<p>Attack time, in seconds.</p>

<p class="var">Decay time</p>
<p>Decay time, in seconds.</p>

<p class="var">Sustain time</p>
<p>Sustain time when the note is hold, in seconds.
Indicates how long the envelope takes to fall down to 0 after the decay
section.
If the parameter is &ge;&nbsp;255, the sustain time is considered as infinite
and the envelope drops only on a Note Off event.</p>

<p class="var">Sustain level</p>
<p>Sustain level, reached after the decay section.
Can be negative or greater than 1 in absolute value.</p>

<p class="var">Release time</p>
<p>Release time to 0, in seconds.
This section is run when a Note Off event is sent to the envelope
generator.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-ramp"></a>Control ramp — Parameter transition</h3>

<p>This effect is only available in the control signal generator category
since it does not process any audio signals, either input or output.
Its purpose is to create a signal that gradually changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to
0.</p>
<p>The transition is initiated as soon as the effect is activated.
However, it can be restarted at any time by setting the <var>Set position</var>
parameter.</p>

<p class="var">Time</p>
<p>Transition duration, in seconds.</p>

<p class="var">Amplitude</p>
<p>Transition amplitude, in %.</p>

<p class="var">Curve</p>
<p>Transition curve.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Curve</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Linear</span></td><td>Smooth transition</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Acc&nbsp;1</span></td><td rowspan="4">Slow at the beginning, faster at the end</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="ui">Slow&nbsp;1</span></td><td rowspan="2">Slow at the middle</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="ui">Slow&nbsp;2</span></td></tr>
</table>

<p class="var">Sample and hold</p>
<p>This parameter adds steps to the transition curve by regularly blocking its
value for a short period.
It is expressed as a ratio between the blocked period and the total transition
time.</p>

<p class="var">Smoothing</p>
<p>Parameter that softens abrupt transitions.
It determines the ratio between the rise time and the transition time.
This parameter is made to work with <var>Sample and hold</var>.</p>

<p class="var">Direction</p>
<p>Gives the transition direction.
Standard direction is from 0 to 1.
Inverted, it is from 1 to 0.</p>

<p class="var">Set position</p>
<p>Sets the current point in the transition, as a percentage of progression.
So it can be restarted if it was already completed.
If you put an initial delay and want to restart the ramp immediately, set the
position slightly above 0.</p>

<p class="var">Initial delay</p>
<p>Time in seconds before the ramp kicks in after.
The delay phase is started again when the position is set to exactly 0.</p>

<p class="var">State</p>
<p>This parameter is meant to pause the transition.</p>



<h3><a id="fx-lfo"></a>LFO — Low frequency oscillator</h3>

<p>This effect is only available in the control signal generator category
since it does not process any audio signals, either input or output.
Its purpose is to create an oscillating signal in order to modulate one or
more parameters from another effect.</p>
<p>The LFO effect has a graphic display, showing one or more cycle of the
current waveform.
The first parameter in the graphic editor is the number of cycles shown.
It is followed by the standard LFO parameters.</p>
<p>The LFO is available in two flavours: the normal one and the slow one.
The slow version can achieve very slow ocillation durations, over a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p class="var">Speed</p>
<p>Oscillation frequency, in Hz.
This is the time setting for the normal LFO</p>

<p class="var">Period</p>
<p>Oscillation period, in seconds.
This is the time setting for the slow LFO.</p>

<p class="var">Amplitude</p>
<p>Oscillation amplitude, percent.</p>

<p class="var">Waveform</p>
<p>Waveform generated by the LFO.
Each form is described below:</p>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Sine</span></li></ul>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-sine.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Triangle</span></li></ul>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-triangle.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Square</span></li></ul>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-square.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Saw</span></li></ul>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-saw.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Parabola</span></li></ul>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-parabola.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Biphase</span></li></ul>
<p>This form regularly alternates between two out-of-phase sines.
It is controlled by two additional parameters:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><var>Variation&nbsp;1</var></td><td>Time</td><td>Controls how an elementary period is split.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>Variation&nbsp;2</var></td><td>Phase</td><td>Phase between the two subwaves.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>16 parts, phase quadrature:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-biphase-050-025.png" /></div>
<p>32 parts, slight dephasing:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-biphase-0625-003125.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">N-Phase</span></li></ul>
<p>This form is an extension of the <span class="ui">Biphase</span>,
consisting of a variable number of out-of-phase sines.
The LFO moves regularly from one phase to the next one, each in turn.
The phases of the subwave are fixed and evenly distributed.
Therefore the phase shift depends on the number of phases.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><var>Variation&nbsp;1</var></td><td>Time</td><td>Controls how an elementary period is split.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>Variation&nbsp;2</var></td><td>Phase</td><td>Number of phases.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>28 parts, 2 phases:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-nphase-060-000.png" /></div>
<p>16 parts, 3 phases:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-nphase-050-015.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Varislope</span></li></ul>
<p>It is a wave that can embody different shapes located between the square,
the triangle and the sawtooth.
The precise shape can be controlled using the two auxiliary parameters.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><var>Variation&nbsp;1</var></td><td>Time</td><td>Determines the time position of the first extremum of the curve relative to the entire period.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>Variation&nbsp;2</var></td><td>Shape</td><td>Shape of the transitio between two extrema.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Time&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&#8239;%, Shape&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&#8239;%:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-varislope-025-000.png" /></div>
<p>Time&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&#8239;%, Shape&nbsp;=&nbsp;50&#8239;%:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-varislope-025-050.png" /></div>
<p>Time&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&#8239;%, Shape varying from 0 to 100&#8239;%:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-varislope-025-morph.png" /></div>

<ul><li><span class="ui">Noise</span></li></ul>
<p>This is white noise filtered by a low pass at 12&#8239;dB/octave, whose
cutoff frequency depends on the <var>Speed</var> parameter.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-noise.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Sample and hold</p>
<p>This parameter creates steps in the LFO curve by regularly blocking its value for a short period.
It determines the ratio between the blocking period and the main oscillation period.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-sine-snh.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Smoothing</p>
<p>Parameter that softens abrupt transitions in the waveform.
It determines the ratio between the rise time and the main oscillation period.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-square-smooth.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Chaos amount</p>
<p>This parameter introduces a chaotic element in the oscillations.
It randomly accelerates or slows down the oscillator, ensuring that it always
falls back on its feet so that the overall rhythm is maintained.
It's a very simple way to add a little life to an oscillation.
Below the same phase distortion applied to two waveforms:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-sine-chaos.png" /></div>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-saw-chaos.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Phase dist amount</p>
<p>Phase distorsion.
This parameter is used to move the time position of the middle of the waveform.
It corresponds to a pulse width setting.
Here, on a sine:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-sine-phdist-025-000.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Phase dist offset</p>
<p>Parameter that allows to change the fixed points as well as the one moved
in the phase distortion.
Below, the same deformation as previously by moving the point located at 3/4
(lower part of the wave):</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-sine-phdist-025-025.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Sign</p>
<p>Invert the LFO sign.
It is used, for example, to transform a rising sawtooth into a descending
one:</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-saw-inv.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Polarity</p>
<p>Switching to unipolar.
This parameter moves up and compresses the curve so that the bottom is at zero.
This mode can simplify the modulation rate settings because the minimum of the
LFO corresponds to the basic value of the modulated parameter.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="lfo-square-uni.png" /></div>

<p class="var">Variation 1, Variation 2</p>
<p>The meaning of these two parameters depends on the selected waveform.</p>

<p class="var">Phase set</p>
<p>Manually sets the phase of the LFO, in degrees.
The value 360 does not cause any change.
This is useful when you want to apply a preset without changing the current
phase.</p>

<h4>Graphic editing</h4>

<p>You can also adjust the LFO settings with an immediate graphical 
preview of the waveform.</p>
<div class="pic"><img src="fx-gui-lfo.png" class="reduce" /></div>
<p>The parameters can be scrolled as usual, they are displayed one by one at
the bottom left.
The very first parameter <span class="ui">Cycles</span> indicates how
many oscillation cycles have to be displayed.</p>
<p>The dots at the bottom right give the precision of the changes obtained
with the <span class="keya">←</span> and <span class="keya">→</span> keys.
This precision can be changed with <span class="key">Select</span>.
<span class="key">Esc</span> to go back to the main parameter screen.</p>
